Made with v 0.1 of Medley by William Kasel
Layout: Bootstrap 3.0.0 w/ flatstrap
Templates: Jade
css: Less
JS: Coffeescript -- JQuery

## Getting Started
-----
Ensure you have installed [Node](nodejs.org) & [NPM](https://npmjs.org/), otherwise you won't be able to compile anything. Ensure you have [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/) installed as well. It makes your life much easier with the pre-compilers. Also, as of this writing, we depend on the 0.4.0 version of Grunt, so some grunt plugins won't work because they changed a ton of things. 

_On first install:_

  `(sudo) npm install`

Once you're ready done with the initial setup, you will be able to do the following:
  
  `grunt watch`
  
That's it! It will compile the Coffeescript, Less, Jade, and generated JS from Coffeescript, plus it concat's, uglifies, and gzips!

*Javascript -> [coffeescript](js/coffee)
*Templates -> [jade](templates/jade) (compiles to /static (handlebars))
*CSS -> [less](css/less)
